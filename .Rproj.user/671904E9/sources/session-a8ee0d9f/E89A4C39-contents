```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("arthur-shaw/susoapi",force = TRUE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
# set_credentials(
#   server = "yemenhbs2025-demo",
#   workspace = "yemenhbs_supv",
#   user = "yemenhbs_api",
#   password = "yemenHBS2025!"
#)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
